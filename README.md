## Overview
Solar Panels are aiming to provide sustainable, renewable energy by installing solar PV systems in a designated area, whether it is residential, commercial, or industrial. The system will capture sunlight through photovoltaic cells, convert it into electrical energy, and either supply power to the building or feed it into the electrical grid.

SunCityLA project is a full-stack application, designed to support residents, in one hand, to schedule/manage their appointments and City Hall Employees, in another hand, to manage/plan visits effectively and in a timely manner. The  residents can submit requests using preferred times and validated addresses,also allowing to receive notifications regarding their appointments. 
The app includes an admin interface for authorized City Hall Employees to view as well as resident interface, to plan visit schedules.

## Our Mission 
SunCityLA project is centered around promoting sustainable energy solutions by harnessing the power of the sun to reduce environmental impact, provide affordable electricity, and contribute to global energy independence. Also Support Economic Growth, Foster Technological Innovation, Encourage Environmental Responsibility, Promote Energy Security, and Inspire Future Generations!
