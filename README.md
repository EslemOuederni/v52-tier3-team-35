## SunCityLA Solar Panel Project

Solar Panels are aiming to provide sustainable, renewable energy by installing solar PV systems in a designated area, whether it is residential, commercial, or industrial. The system will capture sunlight through photovoltaic cells, convert it into electrical energy, and either supply power to the building or feed it into the electrical grid.
